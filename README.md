# Product Catalog

Product Catalog is an online retail application mimicking an electronics store with a focus on mobile phones, tablets, and accessories. This project is constructed using React, TypeScript, SCSS for dynamic client-side rendering, with a product catalog fetched from an API, mirroring real-world commercial platforms.

Key Features and Implementations in the Product Catalog:

### React and TypeScript

The application harnesses the power of React for component-based UI development, enhanced by TypeScript's static type-checking to ensure more maintainable and error-resistant code.

### Modular Component Architecture

Crafted with a focus on reusability, the app's structure is composed of distinct components and helpers, enabling a modular and scalable approach to development.

### SCSS for Advanced Styling

Each component is styled with SCSS, leveraging its functionalities like variables, nesting, and mixins for a more efficient and flexible styling process.

### Dynamic API Data Fetching

Product listings are dynamically retrieved from a backend API, ensuring the catalog reflects the most current inventory data.

### Local Storage Utilization

Both the shopping cart and favorites feature persist user choices between sessions using the browser's local storage, providing a continuous and personalized shopping experience.

### BEM Methodology for CSS

Utilizes the BEM naming convention, streamlining the styling process and increasing code legibility and maintainability.

### Product Filtering and Sorting

Implements versatile options for users to sort and filter products, accommodating a tailored browsing experience.

### Paginated Product Display

Incorporates pagination controls to navigate extensive product lists with ease, improving the overall user interface.

### React Router for Seamless Navigation

Leverages React Router for fluid in-app routing, avoiding page reloads and enhancing user flow.

### Integrated Search Feature

Features a search component to enable quick product discoveries across various categories directly from the header.

### Favorites Functionality

Empowers users to curate their own collection of favored items, accessible via a dedicated favorites page.

### Comprehensive Product Details

Provides detailed pages for each product, complete with extensive information, multiple images, and suggestions for related items.

### Graceful Error Handling

Employs thoughtful error handling strategies to ensure users are guided correctly in the event of missing content or connectivity issues.

### Contextual State Management

Manages application state efficiently, considering the possibility of utilizing React's Context API or state management libraries to handle complex stateful logic.


This React Product Catalog exemplifies the fusion of modern web technologies and design patterns, resulting in a rich, user-centric e-commerce experience bolstered by the reliability and sophistication of TypeScript.
